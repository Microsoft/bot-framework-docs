# Handle user and conversation events

This article demonstrates how your bot can handle events such as a user joining a conversation or adding a bot to a contacts list. 


## Greet a user on conversation join
The Bot Framework provides the [conversationUpdate][conversationUpdate] event for notifying your bot when a user joins or leaves a conversation.

Your bot can greet the user or perform other first-run activities when a user joins the conversation. 

[!include[conversationUpdate sample Node.js](../includes/snippet-code-node-conversationupdate-1.md)]

## Acknowledge add to contacts list

The [contactRelationUpdate][contactRelationUpdate] event notifies your bot that a user has added you to their contacts list.

## Add a first-run dialog

Since the **conversationUpdate** and the **contactRelationUpdate** event are not supported by all channels,
a universal way to greet a user who joins a conversation is to add a first-run dialog.

In the following example we’ve added a function that triggers the dialog any time we’ve never seen a user before. 
You can customize the way an action is triggered by providing an [onFindAction][onFindAction] handler for your action. 

[!include[first-run sample Node.js](../includes/snippet-code-node-first-run-dialog-1.md)]


You can also customize what an action does after its been triggered by providing an [onSelectAction][onSelectAction] handler. 
For trigger actions you can provide an [onInterrupted][onInterrupted] handler to intercept an interruption before it occurs.
