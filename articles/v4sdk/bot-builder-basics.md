# How bots work

[!INCLUDE [pre-release-label](../includes/pre-release-label.md)]

A bot is an app that users interact with in a conversational way, using text, graphics (such as cards or images), or speech. Every interaction between the user and the bot generates an *activity*. The Bot Framework Service, which is a component of the Azure Bot Service, sends information between the user's bot-connected app (such as Facebook, Skype, Slack, etc. which we call the *channel*) and the bot. Each channel may include additional information in the activities they send. Before creating bots, it is important to understand how a bot uses activity objects to communicate with its users. Let's first take a look at activities that are exchanged when we run a simple echo bot. 

![activity diagram](media/bot-builder-activity.png)

Two activity types illustrated here are: *conversation update* and *message*.

The Bot Framework Service may send a conversation update when a party joins the conversation. For example, on starting a conversation with the Bot Framework Emulator, you will see two conversation update activities (one for the user joining the conversation and one for the bot joining). To distinguish these conversation update activities, check whether the *members added* property includes a member other than the bot. 

The message activity carries conversation information between the parties. In an echo bot example, the message activities are carrying simple text and the channel will render this text. Alternatively, the message activity might carry text to be spoken, suggested actions or cards to be displayed.

In this example, the bot created and sent a message activity in response to the inbound message activity it had received. However, a bot can respond in other ways to a received message activity; it’s not uncommon for a bot to respond to a conversation update activity by sending some welcome text in a message activity. More information can be found in [welcoming the user](bot-builder-welcome-user.md).

### HTTP Details

Activities arrive at the bot from the Bot Framework Service via an HTTP POST request. The bot responds to the inbound POST request with a 200 HTTP status code. Activities sent from the bot to the channel are sent on a separate HTTP POST to the Bot Framework Service. This, in turn, is acknowledged with a 200 HTTP status code.

The protocol doesn’t specify the order in which these POST requests and their acknowledgments are made. However, to fit with common HTTP service frameworks, typically these requests are nested, meaning that the outbound HTTP request is made from the bot within the scope of the inbound HTTP request. This pattern is illustrated in the diagram above. Since there are two distinct HTTP connections back to back, the security model must provide for both.

### Defining a turn

In a conversation, people often speak one-at-a-time, taking turns speaking. With a bot, it generally reacts to user input. Within the Bot Framework SDK, a _turn_ consists of the user's incoming activity to the bot and any activity the bot sends back to the user as an immediate response. You can think of a turn as the processing associated with the arrival of a given activity.

The *turn context* object provides information about the activity such as the sender and receiver, the channel, and other data needed to process the activity. It also allows for the addition of information during the turn across various layers of the bot.

The turn context is one of the most important abstractions in the SDK. Not only does it carry the inbound activity to all the middleware components and the application logic but it also provides the mechanism whereby the middleware components and the application logic can send outbound activities.

## The activity processing stack

Let's drill into the previous diagram with a focus on the arrival of a message activity.

![activity processing stack](media/bot-builder-activity-processing-stack.png)

In the example above, the bot replied to the message activity with another message activity containing the same text message. Processing starts with the HTTP POST request, with the activity information carried as a JSON payload, arriving at the web server. In C# this will typically be an ASP.NET project, in a JavaScript Node.js project this is likely to be one of the popular frameworks such as Express or Restify.

The *adapter*, an integrated component of the SDK, is the core of the SDK runtime. The activity is carried as JSON in the HTTP POST body. This JSON is deserialized to create the Activity object that is then handed to the adapter with a call to *process activity* method. On receiving the activity, the adapter creates a *turn context* and calls the middleware. The name *turn context* follows from the use of the word “turn” to describe all the processing associated with the arrival of an activity. The turn context is one of the most important abstractions in the SDK, not only does it carry the inbound activity to all the middleware components and the application logic, but it also provides the mechanism for the middleware components and the application logic to send outbound activities. The turn context provides _send, update, and delete activity_ response methods to respond to an activity. Each response method runs in an asynchronous process. 

[!INCLUDE [alert-await-send-activity](../includes/alert-await-send-activity.md)]


## Middleware
Middleware is much like any other messaging middleware, comprising a linear set of components that are each executed in order, giving each a chance to operate on the activity. The final stage of the middleware pipeline is a callback to invoke the turn handler (`OnTurnAsync` in C# and `onTurn` in JS) function on the bot class the application has registered with the adapter. The turn handler takes a turn context as its argument, typically the application logic running inside the turn handler function will process the inbound activity’s content and generate one or more activities in response, sending these out using the *send activity* function on the turn context. Calling *send activity* on the turn context will cause the middleware components to be invoked on the outbound activities. Middleware components execute before and after the bot’s turn handler function. The execution is inherently nested and, as such, sometimes referred to being like a Russian Doll. For more in depth information about middleware, see the [middleware topic](~/v4sdk/bot-builder-concept-middleware.md).

## Bot structure
In the following sections, we examine key pieces of a bot.

### Prerequisites
- A copy of the **EchoBotWithCounter** sample in either [C#](https://aka.ms/EchoBotWithStateCSharp) or [JS](https://aka.ms/EchoBotWithStateJS). Only relevant code is shown here, but you can refer to the sample for complete source code.

# [C#](#tab/cs)

A bot is a type of [ASP.NET Core](https://docs.microsoft.com/aspnet/core/?view=aspnetcore-2.1) web application. If you look at the [ASP.NET](https://docs.microsoft.com/aspnet/core/fundamentals/index?view=aspnetcore-2.1&tabs=aspnetcore2x) fundamentals, you'll see similar code in files such as **Program.cs** and **Startup.cs**. These files are required for all web apps and are not bot specific. 

### Bot logic

The main bot logic is defined in the `EchoWithCounterBot` class that derives from the `IBot` interface. `IBot` defines a single method `OnTurnAsync`. Your application must implement this method. `OnTurnAsync` has turnContext that provides information about the incoming activity. The incoming activity corresponds to the inbound HTTP request. Activities can be of various types, so we first check to see if your bot has received a message. If it is a message, we  get the conversation state from the turn context, increment the turn counter, and then persist the new turn counter value into the conversation state. And then send a message back to the user using SendActivityAsync call. The outgoing activity corresponds to the outbound HTTP request.

```cs
public async Task OnTurnAsync(ITurnContext turnContext, CancellationToken cancellationToken = default(CancellationToken))
{
    if (turnContext.Activity.Type == ActivityTypes.Message)
    {
        // Get the conversation state from the turn context.
        var oldState = await _accessors.CounterState.GetAsync(turnContext, () => new CounterState());

        // Bump the turn count for this conversation.
        var newState = new CounterState { TurnCount = oldState.TurnCount + 1 };

        // Set the property using the accessor.
        await _accessors.CounterState.SetAsync(turnContext, newState);

        // Save the new turn count into the conversation state.
        await _accessors.ConversationState.SaveChangesAsync(turnContext);

        // Echo back to the user whatever they typed.
        var responseMessage = $"Turn {newState.TurnCount}: You sent '{turnContext.Activity.Text}'\n";
        await turnContext.SendActivityAsync(responseMessage);
    }
    else
    {
        await turnContext.SendActivityAsync($"{turnContext.Activity.Type} event detected");
    }
}
```

### Set up services

The `ConfigureServices` method in the startup.cs file loads the connected services from [.bot](bot-builder-basics.md#the-bot-file) file, catches any errors that occur during a conversation turn and logs them, sets up your credential provider and creates a conversation state object to store conversation data in memory.

```csharp
services.AddBot<EchoWithCounterBot>(options =>
{
    // Creates a logger for the application to use.
    ILogger logger = _loggerFactory.CreateLogger<EchoWithCounterBot>();

    var secretKey = Configuration.GetSection("botFileSecret")?.Value;
    var botFilePath = Configuration.GetSection("botFilePath")?.Value;

    // Loads .bot configuration file and adds a singleton that your Bot can access through dependency injection.
    BotConfiguration botConfig = null;
    try
    {
        botConfig = BotConfiguration.Load(botFilePath ?? @".\BotConfiguration.bot", secretKey);
    }
    catch
    {
        //...
    }

    services.AddSingleton(sp => botConfig);

    // Retrieve current endpoint.
    var environment = _isProduction ? "production" : "development";
    var service = botConfig.Services.Where(s => s.Type == "endpoint" && s.Name == environment).FirstOrDefault();
    if (!(service is EndpointService endpointService))
    {
        throw new InvalidOperationException($"The .bot file does not contain an endpoint with name '{environment}'.");
    }

    options.CredentialProvider = new SimpleCredentialProvider(endpointService.AppId, endpointService.AppPassword);

    // Catches any errors that occur during a conversation turn and logs them.
    options.OnTurnError = async (context, exception) =>
    {
        logger.LogError($"Exception caught : {exception}");
        await context.SendActivityAsync("Sorry, it looks like something went wrong.");
    };

    // The Memory Storage used here is for local bot debugging only. When the bot
    // is restarted, everything stored in memory will be gone.
    IStorage dataStore = new MemoryStorage();

    // ...

    // Create Conversation State object.
    // The Conversation State object is where we persist anything at the conversation-scope.
    var conversationState = new ConversationState(dataStore);

    options.State.Add(conversationState);
});
```

The `ConfigureServices` method also creates and registers `EchoBotAccessors` that are defined in the **EchoBotStateAccessors.cs** file and are passed into the public `EchoWithCounterBot` constructor using dependency injection framework in ASP.NET Core.

```csharp
// Accessors created here are passed into the IBot-derived class on every turn.
services.AddSingleton<EchoBotAccessors>(sp =>
{
    var options = sp.GetRequiredService<IOptions<BotFrameworkOptions>>().Value;
    // ...
    var conversationState = options.State.OfType<ConversationState>().FirstOrDefault();
    // ...

    // Create the custom state accessor.
    // State accessors enable other components to read and write individual properties of state.
    var accessors = new EchoBotAccessors(conversationState)
    {
        CounterState = conversationState.CreateProperty<CounterState>(EchoBotAccessors.CounterStateName),
    };

    return accessors;
});
```

The `Configure` method finishes the configuration of your app by specifying that the app use the Bot Framework and a few other files. All bots using the Bot Framework will need that configuration call. `ConfigureServices` and `Configure` are called by the runtime when the app starts.

### Manage state

This file contains a simple class that our bot uses to maintain the current state. It contains only an `int` that we use to increment your the counter.

```cs
public class CounterState
{
    public int TurnCount { get; set; } = 0;
}
```

### Accessor class

The `EchoBotAccessors` class is created as a singleton in the `Startup` class and passed into the IBot derived class. In this case, `public class EchoWithCounterBot : IBot`. The bot uses the accessor to persist conversation data. The constructor of `EchoBotAccessors` is passed in a conversation object that is created in the Startup.cs file.

```cs
public class EchoBotAccessors
{
    public EchoBotAccessors(ConversationState conversationState)
    {
        ConversationState = conversationState ?? throw new ArgumentNullException(nameof(conversationState));
    }

    public static string CounterStateName { get; } = $"{nameof(EchoBotAccessors)}.CounterState";

    public IStatePropertyAccessor<CounterState> CounterState { get; set; }

    public ConversationState ConversationState { get; }
}
```

# [JavaScript](#tab/js)

The Yeoman generator creates a type of [restify](http://restify.com/) web application. If you look at the restify quickstart in their docs, you'll see an app similar to the generated **index.js** file. This section mainly describes the **package.json**, **.env** , **index.js**, **bot.js**, and **echobot-with-counter.bot** files. Code in some files won't be copied here, but you will see it when you run the bot, and you can refer to the [Node.js echobot-with-counter](https://aka.ms/js-echobot-with-counter) sample.

### package.json

**package.json** specifies dependencies and their associated versions for your bot. This is all set up by the template and your system.

### .env file

The **.env** file specifies the configuration information for your bot, such as the port number, app ID, and password among other things. If using certain technologies or using this bot in production, you will need to add your specific keys or URL to this configuration. For this Echo bot, however, you don't need to do anything here right now; the app ID and password may be left undefined at this time.

To use the **.env** configuration file, the template needs an extra package included.  First, get the `dotenv` package from npm:

`npm install dotenv`

### index.js

The `index.js` sets up your bot and the hosting service that will forward activities to your bot logic.

#### Required libraries

At the very top of your `index.js` file you will find a series of modules or libraries that are being required. These modules will give you access to a set of functions that you may want to include in your application.

```javascript
// Import required packages
const path = require('path');
const restify = require('restify');

// Import required bot services. See https://aka.ms/bot-services to learn more about the different parts of a bot.
const { BotFrameworkAdapter, ConversationState, MemoryStorage } = require('botbuilder');
// Import required bot configuration.
const { BotConfiguration } = require('botframework-config');

const { EchoBot } = require('./bot');

// Read botFilePath and botFileSecret from .env file
// Note: Ensure you have a .env file and include botFilePath and botFileSecret.
const ENV_FILE = path.join(__dirname, '.env');
const env = require('dotenv').config({ path: ENV_FILE });
```

#### Bot configuration

The next part loads information from your bot configuration file.

```javascript
// Get the .bot file path
// See https://aka.ms/about-bot-file to learn more about .bot file its use and bot configuration.
const BOT_FILE = path.join(__dirname, (process.env.botFilePath || ''));
let botConfig;
try {
    // Read bot configuration from .bot file.
    botConfig = BotConfiguration.loadSync(BOT_FILE, process.env.botFileSecret);
} catch (err) {
    console.error(`\nError reading bot file. Please ensure you have valid botFilePath and botFileSecret set for your environment.`);
    console.error(`\n - The botFileSecret is available under appsettings for your Azure Bot Service bot.`);
    console.error(`\n - If you are running this bot locally, consider adding a .env file with botFilePath and botFileSecret.`);
    console.error(`\n - See https://aka.ms/about-bot-file to learn more about .bot file its use and bot configuration.\n\n`);
    process.exit();
}

// For local development configuration as defined in .bot file
const DEV_ENVIRONMENT = 'development';

// Define name of the endpoint configuration section from the .bot file
const BOT_CONFIGURATION = (process.env.NODE_ENV || DEV_ENVIRONMENT);

// Get bot endpoint configuration by service name
// Bot configuration as defined in .bot file
const endpointConfig = botConfig.findServiceByNameOrId(BOT_CONFIGURATION);
```

#### Bot adapter, HTTP server, and bot state

The next parts set up the server and adapter that allow your bot to communicate with the user and send responses. The server will listen on the specified port from the **BotConfiguration.bot** configuration file, or fall back to _3978_ for connection with your emulator. The adapter will act as the conductor for your bot, directing incoming and outgoing communication, authentication, and so on.

We also create a state object that uses `MemoryStorage` as the storage provider. This state is defined as `ConversationState`, which just means it's keeping the state of your conversation. `ConversationState` will store the information you're interested in, which in this case is simply a turn counter, in memory.

```javascript
// Create bot adapter.
// See https://aka.ms/about-bot-adapter to learn more about bot adapter.
const adapter = new BotFrameworkAdapter({
    appId: endpointConfig.appId || process.env.microsoftAppID,
    appPassword: endpointConfig.appPassword || process.env.microsoftAppPassword
});

// Catch-all for any unhandled errors in your bot.
adapter.onTurnError = async (context, error) => {
    // This check writes out errors to console log .vs. app insights.
    console.error(`\n [onTurnError]: ${ error }`);
    // Send a message to the user
    context.sendActivity(`Oops. Something went wrong!`);
    // Clear out state
    await conversationState.clear(context);
    // Save state changes.
    await conversationState.saveChanges(context);
};

// Define a state store for your bot. See https://aka.ms/about-bot-state to learn more about using MemoryStorage.
// A bot requires a state store to persist the dialog and user state between messages.
let conversationState;

// For local development, in-memory storage is used.
// CAUTION: The Memory Storage used here is for local bot debugging only. When the bot
// is restarted, anything stored in memory will be gone.
const memoryStorage = new MemoryStorage();
conversationState = new ConversationState(memoryStorage);

// Create the main dialog.
const bot = new EchoBot(conversationState);

// Create HTTP server
let server = restify.createServer();
server.listen(process.env.port || process.env.PORT || 3978, function() {
    console.log(`\n${ server.name } listening to ${ server.url }`);
    console.log(`\nGet Bot Framework Emulator: https://aka.ms/botframework-emulator`);
    console.log(`\nTo talk to your bot, open echoBot-with-counter.bot file in the Emulator`);
});
```

#### Bot Logic

The adapter's `processActivity` sends incoming activities to the bot logic.
The third parameter within `processActivity` is a function handler that will be called to perform the bot’s logic after the received [activity](#the-activity-processing-stack) has been pre-processed by the adapter and routed through any middleware. The turn context variable, passed as an argument to the function handler, can be used to provide information about the incoming activity, the sender and receiver, the channel, the conversation, etc. Activity processing is routed to the EchoBot's `onTurn`.

```javascript
// Listen for incoming requests.
server.post('/api/messages', (req, res) => {
    // Route received request to adapter for processing
    adapter.processActivity(req, res, (context) => {
        // Route to main dialog.
        await bot.onTurn(context);
    });
});
```

### EchoBot

All activity processing is routed to this class's `onTurn` handler. When the class is created, a state object is passed in. Using this state object, the constructor creates a `this.countProperty` accessor to persist the turn counter for this bot.

On each turn, we first check to see if the bot has received a message. If the bot did not receive a message, we will echo back the activity type received. Next, we create a state variable that holds the information of your bot's conversation. If the count variable is `undefined`, it is set to 1 (which will occur when your bot first starts) or increment it with every new message. We echo back to the user the count along with the message they sent. Finally, we set the count and save the changes to state.

```javascript
const { ActivityTypes } = require('botbuilder');

// Turn counter property
const TURN_COUNTER_PROPERTY = 'turnCounterProperty';

class EchoBot {

    constructor(conversationState) {
        // Creates a new state accessor property.
        // See https://aka.ms/about-bot-state-accessors to learn more about the bot state and state accessors
        this.countProperty = conversationState.createProperty(TURN_COUNTER_PROPERTY);
        this.conversationState = conversationState;
    }

    async onTurn(turnContext) {
        // Handle message activity type. User's responses via text or speech or card interactions flow back to the bot as Message activity.
        // Message activities may contain text, speech, interactive cards, and binary or unknown attachments.
        // see https://aka.ms/about-bot-activity-message to learn more about the message and other activity types
        if (turnContext.activity.type === ActivityTypes.Message) {
            // read from state.
            let count = await this.countProperty.get(turnContext);
            count = count === undefined ? 1 : ++count;
            await turnContext.sendActivity(`${ count }: You said "${ turnContext.activity.text }"`);
            // increment and set turn counter.
            await this.countProperty.set(turnContext, count);
        } else {
            // Generic handler for all other activity types.
            await turnContext.sendActivity(`[${ turnContext.activity.type } event detected]`);
        }
        // Save state changes
        await this.conversationState.saveChanges(turnContext);
    }
}

exports.EchoBot = EchoBot;
```

## The bot file

The **.bot** file contains information, including the endpoint, app ID, and password, and references to services that are used by the bot. This file gets created for you when you start building a bot from a template, but you can create your own through the emulator or other tools. You can specify the .bot file to use when testing your bot with the [emulator](../bot-service-debug-emulator.md).

```json
{
    "name": "echobot-with-counter",
    "services": [
        {
            "type": "endpoint",
            "name": "development",
            "endpoint": "http://localhost:3978/api/messages",
            "appId": "",
            "appPassword": "",
            "id": "1"
        }
    ],
    "padlock": "",
    "version": "2.0"
}
```
