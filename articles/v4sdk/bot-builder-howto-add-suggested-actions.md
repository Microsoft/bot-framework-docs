# Add suggested actions to messages

[!include[Introduction to suggested actions](../includes/snippet-suggested-actions-intro.md)] 

## Send suggested actions

You can create a list of suggested actions (also known as "quick replies") that will be shown to the user for a single turn of the conversation:

# [C#](#tab/csharp)

```csharp
using Microsoft.Bot.Builder;
using Microsoft.Bot.Builder.Core.Extensions;
using Microsoft.Bot.Schema;

// Create the activity and add suggested actions.
var activity = MessageFactory.SuggestedActions(
    new CardAction[]
    {
        new CardAction(title: "red", type: ActionTypes.ImBack, value: "red"),
        new CardAction( title: "green", type: ActionTypes.ImBack, value: "green"),
        new CardAction(title: "blue", type: ActionTypes.ImBack, value: "blue")
    }, text: "Choose a color");

// Send the activity as a reply to the user.
await context.SendActivity(activity);
```

# [JavaScript](#tab/javascript)

```javascript
// Require MessageFactory from botbuilder.
const {MessageFactory} = require('botbuilder');

//  Initialize the message object.
const basicMessage = MessageFactory.suggestedActions(['red', 'green', 'blue'], 'Choose a color');

await context.sendActivity(basicMessage);
```
