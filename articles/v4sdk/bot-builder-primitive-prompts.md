# Create your own prompts to gather user input

[!INCLUDE [pre-release-label](../includes/pre-release-label.md)]

A conversation between a bot and a user often involves asking (prompting) the user for information, parsing the user's response, and then acting on that information.

Your bot should track the context of a conversation, so that it can manage its behavior and remember answers to previous questions. A bot's *state* is information it tracks to respond appropriately to incoming messages.

## Prerequisites

- The code in this article is based on the **Prompt Users for Input** sample. You'll need a copy of the sample in either [C#](https://aka.ms/cs-primitive-prompt-sample) or [JS](https://aka.ms/js-primitive-prompt-sample).
- Knowledge of [managing state](bot-builder-concept-state.md) and how to [save user and conversation data](bot-builder-howto-v4-state.md).
- [Bot Framework Emulator](https://aka.ms/Emulator-wiki-getting-started), to test the bot locally.

## About the sample code

In this article, we ask the user a series of questions, validate some of their answers, and save their input.
We use the bot's turn handler and user and conversation state properties to manage the flow of the conversation and the collection of input.

1. Define and configure state
1. Use state properties to direct the conversation
   1. Update the bot's turn handler.
   1. Implement a helper method to mange the collection of user data.
   1. Implement validation methods for the user input.

## Define and configure state

We need to configure our bot the track the following information:

- The user's name, age, and chosen date, which we'll define in user state.
- What we've just asked the user, which we'll define in conversation state.

Since we don't plan to deploy this bot, we'll configure both user and conversation state to use _memory storage_. Below, we describe some key aspects of the configuration code.

# [C#](#tab/csharp)

We define the following types.

- A `UserProfile` class for the user information that the bot will collect.
- A `ConversationFlow` class to tack information about where we are in the conversation.
- An inner `ConversationFlow.Question` enumeration for tracking where we are in the conversation.
- A `CustomPromptBotAccessors` class in which to bundle the state management information.

The bot accessors class contains our state management and and state property accessor objects, and it gets passed to the bot via dependency injection in ASP.NET Core. In our bot, we record the state property accessor information that you receive when the bot's created each turn.

# [JavaScript](#tab/javascript)

We create the state management objects and pass them in when we create our bot.
In our bot, we define identifiers for the state properties and for tracking where we are in the conversation and then record the state management objects and create our state property accessors in the bot's constructor.

---

## Use state properties to direct the conversation

Once we have our state properties configured, we can use them in our bot.

- Define our [turn handler](#the-bots-turn-handler) to access state and call our helper method.
- Implement a [helper method](#filling-out-the-user-profile) to manage the collection of the user profile.
- Implement [validation methods](#parse-and-validate-input) to parse and validate the user input.

### The bot's turn handler

We use the state property accessors to get our state properties from the turn context.
If we need to fill out the user profile, we call our helper method and then save any state changes.

# [C#](#tab/csharp)

```csharp
public async Task OnTurnAsync(ITurnContext turnContext, CancellationToken cancellationToken = default(CancellationToken))
{
   if (turnContext.Activity.Type == ActivityTypes.Message)
    {
        // Get the state properties from the turn context.
        ConversationFlow flow = await _accessors.ConversationFlowAccessor.GetAsync(turnContext, () => new ConversationFlow());
        UserProfile profile = await _accessors.UserProfileAccessor.GetAsync(turnContext, () => new UserProfile());

        await FillOutUserProfileAsync(flow, profile, turnContext);

        // Update state and save changes.
        await _accessors.ConversationFlowAccessor.SetAsync(turnContext, flow);
        await _accessors.ConversationState.SaveChangesAsync(turnContext);

        await _accessors.UserProfileAccessor.SetAsync(turnContext, profile);
        await _accessors.UserState.SaveChangesAsync(turnContext);
    }
}
```

# [JavaScript](#tab/javascript)

```javascript
// The bot's turn handler.
async onTurn(turnContext) {
    // This bot listens for message activities.
    if (turnContext.activity.type === ActivityTypes.Message) {
        // Get the state properties from the turn context.
        const flow = await this.conversationFlow.get(turnContext, { lastQuestionAsked: question.none });
        const profile = await this.userProfile.get(turnContext, {});

        await MyBot.fillOutUserProfile(flow, profile, turnContext);

        // Update state and save changes.
        await this.conversationFlow.set(turnContext, flow);
        await this.conversationState.saveChanges(turnContext);

        await this.userProfile.set(turnContext, profile);
        await this.userState.saveChanges(turnContext);
    }
}
```

---

### Filling out the user profile

We'll start by collecting information. Each one will provide a similar interface.

- The return value indicates whether the input is a valid answer for this question.
- If validation passes, it produces a parsed and normalized value to save.
- If validation fails, it produces a message with which the bot can ask for the information again.

 In the [next section](#parse-and-validate-input), we'll define the helper methods to parse and validate user input.

# [C#](#tab/csharp)

```csharp
private static async Task FillOutUserProfileAsync(ConversationFlow flow, UserProfile profile, ITurnContext turnContext)
{
    string input = turnContext.Activity.Text?.Trim();
    string message;
    switch (flow.LastQuestionAsked)
    {
        case ConversationFlow.Question.None:
            await turnContext.SendActivityAsync("Let's get started. What is your name?");
            flow.LastQuestionAsked = ConversationFlow.Question.Name;
            break;
        case ConversationFlow.Question.Name:
            if (ValidateName(input, out string name, out message))
            {
                profile.Name = name;
                await turnContext.SendActivityAsync($"Hi {profile.Name}.");
                await turnContext.SendActivityAsync("How old are you?");
                flow.LastQuestionAsked = ConversationFlow.Question.Age;
                break;
            }
            else
            {
                await turnContext.SendActivityAsync(message ?? "I'm sorry, I didn't understand that.");
                break;
            }
        case ConversationFlow.Question.Age:
            if (ValidateAge(input, out int age, out message))
            {
                profile.Age = age;
                await turnContext.SendActivityAsync($"I have your age as {profile.Age}.");
                await turnContext.SendActivityAsync("When is your flight?");
                flow.LastQuestionAsked = ConversationFlow.Question.Date;
                break;
            }
            else
            {
                await turnContext.SendActivityAsync(message ?? "I'm sorry, I didn't understand that.");
                break;
            }
        case ConversationFlow.Question.Date:
            if (ValidateDate(input, out string date, out message))
            {
                profile.Date = date;
                await turnContext.SendActivityAsync($"Your cab ride to the airport is scheduled for {profile.Date}.");
                await turnContext.SendActivityAsync($"Thanks for completing the booking {profile.Name}.");
                await turnContext.SendActivityAsync($"Type anything to run the bot again.");
                flow.LastQuestionAsked = ConversationFlow.Question.None;
                profile = new UserProfile();
                break;
            }
            else

### Parse and validate input

We'll use the following criteria to validate input.

- The **name** must be a non-empty string. We'll normalize by trimming white-space.
- The **age** must be between 18 and 120. We'll normalize by returning an integer.
- The **date** must be any date or time at least an hour in the future.
  We'll normalize by returning just the date portion of the parsed input.

> [!NOTE]
> For the age and date input, we use the [Microsoft/Recognizers-Text](https://github.com/Microsoft/Recognizers-Text/) libraries to perform the initial parsing.
> While we provide sample code, we do not explain how the text recognizers libraries work, and this is just one way to parse the input.
> For more information about these libraries, see the repository's **README**.

# [C#](#tab/csharp)

Add the following validation methods to your bot.

```csharp
private static bool ValidateName(string input, out string name, out string message)
{
    name = null;
    message = null;

    if (string.IsNullOrWhiteSpace(input))
    {
        message = "Please enter a name that contains at least one character.";
    }
    else
    {
        name = input.Trim();
    }

    return message is null;
}

private static bool ValidateAge(string input, out int age, out string message)
{
    age = 0;
    message = null;

    // Try to recognize the input as a number. This works for responses such as "twelve" as well as "12".
    try
    {
        // Attempt to convert the Recognizer result to an integer. This works for "a dozen", "twelve", "12", and so on.
        // The recognizer returns a list of potential recognition results, if any.
        List<ModelResult> results = NumberRecognizer.RecognizeNumber(input, Culture.English);
        foreach (var result in results)
        {

        DateTime earliest = DateTime.Now.AddHours(1.0);
        foreach (ModelResult result in results)
        {

            var resolutions = result.Resolution["values"] as List<Dictionary<string, string>>;
            foreach (var resolution in resolutions)
            {
                // The processed input contains a "value" entry if it is a date-time value, or "start" and
                // "end" entries if it is a date-time range.
                if (resolution.TryGetValue("value", out string dateString)
                    || resolution.TryGetValue("start", out dateString))
                {
                    if (DateTime.TryParse(dateString, out var candidate)
                        && earliest < candidate)
                    {
                        date = candidate.ToShortDateString();
                        return true;
                    }
                }
            }
        }

        message = "I'm sorry, please enter a date at least an hour out.";
    }
    catch
    {
