# Tutorial: Create and deploy a basic bot

[!INCLUDE [applies-to-v4](../includes/applies-to.md)]

This tutorial walks you through creating a basic bot with the Bot Framework SDK and deploying it to Azure. If you've already created a basic bot and have it running locally, skip ahead to the [Deploy your bot](#deploy-your-bot) section.

In this tutorial, you learn how to:

> * Create a basic Echo bot
> * Run and interact with it locally
> * Publish your bot

If you don't have an Azure subscription, create a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F) before you begin.

## Deploy your bot

### Prerequisites

[!INCLUDE [deploy prerequisite](~/includes/deploy/snippet-prerequisite.md)]

### Prepare for deployment

> [!TIP]
> This procedure uses a ZIP file to deploy your bot. In C#, this may fail if the solution configuration at build is set to **Debug**.
> In Visual Studio, make sure that the solution configuration is set to **Release** and perform a clean rebuild of the solution before continuing.

[!INCLUDE [deploy prepare intro](~/includes/deploy/snippet-prepare-deploy-intro.md)]

#### 1. Login to Azure

[!INCLUDE [deploy az login](~/includes/deploy/snippet-az-login.md)]

#### 2. Set the subscription

[!INCLUDE [deploy az subscription](~/includes/deploy/snippet-az-set-subscription.md)]

#### 3. Create an App registration

[!INCLUDE [deploy create app registration](~/includes/deploy/snippet-create-app-registration.md)]

#### 4. Deploy via ARM template

You can deploy your bot in a new resource group or an existing resource group. Choose the option that works best for you.

> [!NOTE]
> Python bots cannot be deployed to a resource group that contains Windows services/bots.  Multiple Python bots can be deployed to the same resource group, but create other services (LUIS, QnA, etc.) in another resource group.

##### **Deploy via ARM template with new Resource Group**

#### 5. Prepare your code for deployment

[!INCLUDE [Work around for .NET Core 3.1 SDK](~/includes/deploy/samples-workaround-3-1.md)]

##### **Retrieve or create necessary IIS/Kudu files**

[!INCLUDE [retrieve or create IIS/Kudu files](~/includes/deploy/snippet-IIS-Kudu-files.md)]

##### **Zip up the code directory manually**

[!INCLUDE [zip up code](~/includes/deploy/snippet-zip-code.md)]

### Deploy code to Azure
