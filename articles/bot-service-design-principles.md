# Conversational User Experience 
 
We define **Conversational User Experience (CUX)** as a modality of interaction that’s based on natural language. 
When interacting with each other, human beings use conversation to communicate ideas, concepts, data, and emotional information. 
CUX allows us to interact with our devices, apps, and digital services the way we communicate with each other, using phrasing and syntax via voice and text or chat that come naturally. Other modalities can burden users with the task of learning interaction behaviors that are meaningful to the system: the syntax of a command line, the information architecture of a graphical user interface, or the touch affordances of a device. 

CUX turns the tables. 
Instead of users having to learn the system, it’s the system that learns. 
It learns what we teach it about human language – patterns of speech, colloquialisms, chit-chat, even abusive words – so that it can respond appropriately.

Conversational designs—bots, virtual agents, digital assistants, and all other dialog interfaces—offer flexible, accessible, and powerful ways to connect with customers, employees, and one another.
Whether you’re a novice designer or a veteran developer, the concepts described in this section will offer insights to help you craft an effective, responsible, inclusive, and, we hope, delightful experience that tackle a variety of business scenarios. 


## A great conversational bot

Most successful bots have at least one thing in common: a great conversational user experience. 
CUX can be multi-modal – employing text or voice, with or without visual, auditory, or touchenabled components. 
But fundamentally, CUX is human language. 
Already in 2016, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella announced, “Human language is the new UI layer”.
A great conversational bot harnesses the power of your words and supportive UI, to build trust and forge deep connections with your users.

If you are designing a bot, it's safe to assume that you are expecting users to use it. 
It is also safe to assume that you are hoping that users will prefer the bot experience over alternative experiences like apps, websites, phone calls with live agents, and other means of addressing their particular queries. 
Therefore, ensuring a great user experience should be your number one priority when designing a bot. 
Some key questions to consider:

- Does the bot easily solve the user’s problem with minimal back and forth turns?

- Does the bot solve the user’s problem better/easier/faster than any of the alternative experiences?

- Does the bot run on the devices and platforms the user cares about?

- Is the bot discoverable and easy to invoke? Do the users naturally know what to do when using it?

- Does the bot guide the user when they are stuck; either handover to a live agent or provide relevant help?

Users care when the bot actually solves their query. A great conversational bot does not require users to type too much, talk too much, repeat themselves several times, or explain things that the bot should automatically know and remember.

> Regardless of the type of bot you're creating (chatbot, voice assistant, a hybrid combination), make CUX a top priority.


## The CUX guide

By learning the concepts described in the CUX Guide, you'll become equipped to design a bot that aligns with best practices and capitalizes on lessons learned. 
The authors and designers of this guidance are drawing from combined decades of experience building and deploying conversational UI for a variety of bots, virtual agents, and other conversational experience projects including Cortana, Bot Framework Templates, Microsoft Virtual Assistant, Personality Chat, and others. 

> [!TIP]
> Download the [CUX Guide Microsoft.pdf](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/bot-docs/files/6405214/CUX.Guide.Microsoft.pdf)

This CUX guide is divided loosely into a few different sections. 
The first four topics introduce conversational design and explore ways to approach the process ethically and inclusively. 
Topics 5-7, along with our brainstorming worksheet, help you design your ideal experience. 
Finally, topics 8-11 offer practical development tips for building the experience you’ve designed. 
You can jump around and choose only the topics that address your immediate need, or go top to bottom in order.

> [!NOTE]
> A note on terminology: topic four explores several different kinds of conversational experiences, including bots, virtual agents, and digital assistants. 
Within the rest of the guide, we use those terms relatively interchangeably because the principles of development in this guidance apply interchangeably to all of those design types, but we recognize there are distinctions in the industry between those and other conversational designs, and that those terms are sometimes used differently in the industry. 
> Our intention is to offer guidance that will help with most text-based conversational experiences, regardless of their intent.
