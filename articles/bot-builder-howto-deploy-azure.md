# Deploy your bot to Azure

Once you have created your bot and verified it locally, you can push it to Azure to make it accessible from anywhere. To do so, you will first deploy the bot to Azure in an App Service then you’ll configure your bot with the Azure Bot Service using the Bot Channels Registration item.

## Publish from Visual Studio

Use Visual Studio to create your resources in Azure and publish your code.

In the Solution Explorer window, right click on your project’s node and select Publish.

4. In upper right of the dialog, ensure the dialog is showing the correct user ID for your Azure subscription.
