# Test in Web Chat
Bot Service includes the [Web Chat control](bot-service-channel-connect-webchat.md) to help you conveniently test your bot. 

## Test a bot in the Azure Portal with Web Chat
Sign into the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) and open the blade for the bot. In the Bot Management section, click **Test in Web Chat**. Bot Service will load the Web Chat control and connect to your bot.

You can enter text to chat with your bot. If your bot supports speech, you can click the microphone button to talk to your bot. If your bot supports attachments, you can upload an attachment, such as an image. Learn how to add features to your bot with the [Bot Builder SDK](bot-builder-overview-getstarted.md).

> [!NOTE]
> If the Web Chat control is not fully loaded after a few minutes, try refreshing the page.

## Next steps
Now that you know how to test your bot in Azure, learn how to take advantage of the Bot Framework Emulator for deeper testing and debugging capabilities.
