The [Connector](~/dotnet/bot-builder-dotnet-concepts.md#connector) uses an <a href="/dotnet/api/microsoft.bot.connector.activity" target="_blank">Activity</a> object to pass information back and forth between bot and channel (user). 
The most common type of activity is **Message**, but there are other activity types that can be used to communicate various types of information to a bot or channel.
