You'll create a new resource group in Azure and then use the ARM template to create the resources specified in it. In this case, we are providing App Service Plan, Web App, and Bot Channels Registration.

```cmd
az deployment create --name "<name-of-deployment>" --template-file "template-with-new-rg.json" --location "location-name" --parameters appId="<msa-app-guid>" appSecret="<msa-app-password>" botId="<id-or-name-of-bot>" botSku=F0 newAppServicePlanName="<name-of-app-service-plan>" newWebAppName="<name-of-web-app>" groupName="<new-group-name>" groupLocation="<location>" newAppServicePlanLocation="<location>"
```

| template-file | The path to the ARM template. You can use the `template-with-new-rg.json` file provided in the `deploymentTemplates` folder of the project. |

| parameters | Provide deployment parameter values. `appId` value you got from running the `az ad app create` command. `appSecret` is the password you provided in the previous step.
