# Deploy your bot using Azure CLI

[!INCLUDE [pre-release-label](./includes/pre-release-label.md)]

After you have created your bot and tested it locally, you can deploy it to Azure to make it accessible from anywhere. Deploying your bot to Azure will involve paying for the services you use. The [billing and cost management](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/billing/) article helps you understand Azure billing, monitor usage and costs, and manage your account and subscriptions.

In this article, we'll show you how to deploy C# and JavaScript bots to Azure using `az` and `msbot` cli. It would be useful to read this article before following the steps, so that you fully understand what is involved in deploying a bot.

## Prerequisites

- If you don't have an Azure subscription, create a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/) before you begin.
- Install the latest version of the [Azure cli tool](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli?view=azure-cli-latest).
- Install latest version of the [MSBot](https://github.com/Microsoft/botbuilder-tools/tree/master/packages/MSBot) tool.
- Install latest released version of the [Bot Framework Emulator](https://aka.ms/Emulator-wiki-getting-started).
- Install and configure [ngrok](https://github.com/Microsoft/BotFramework-Emulator/wiki/Tunneling-%28ngrok%29).
- Knowledge of [.bot](v4sdk/bot-file-basics.md) file.

With msbot 4.3.2 and later, you need Azure CLI version 2.0.53 or later. If you installed the botservice extension, remove it with this command.

```cmd
az extension remove --name botservice
```

## Deploy JavaScript and C# bots using az cli

You've already created and tested a bot locally, and now you want to deploy it to Azure. These steps assume that you have created the required Azure resources.

Open a command prompt to log in to the Azure portal.

```cmd
az login
```

A browser window will open, allowing you to sign in.

### Set the subscription

Set the default subscription to use.

```cmd
az account set --subscription "<azure-subscription>"
```

If you are not sure which subscription to use for deploying the bot, you can view the list of `subscriptions` for your account by using `az account list` command.

Navigate to the bot folder.

```cmd
cd <local-bot-folder>
```

### Create a Web App Bot

If you don't already have a resource group to which to publish your bot, create one:

```cmd
az group create --name <resource-group-name> --location <geographic-location> --verbose
```

| Option | Description |
|:---|:---|
| --name | A unique name for the resource group. DO NOT include spaces or underscores in the name. |
| --location | Geographic location used to create the resource group. For example, `eastus`, `westus`, `westus2`, and so on. Use `az account list-locations` for a list of locations. |

Then, create the bot resource into which you will publish your bot.

Before proceeding, read the instructions that apply to you based on the type of email account you use to log in to Azure.

#### MSA email account

If you are using an [MSA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_account) email account, you will need to create the app ID and app password on the Application Registration Portal to use with `az bot create` command.

1. Go to the [**Application Registration Portal**](https://apps.dev.microsoft.com/).
1. Click on **Add an app** to register your application, create **Application Id**, and **Generate New Password**. If you already have an application and password but don't remember the password, you will have to generate a new password in the Application secrets section.
1. Save both application ID and the new password you just generated, so you that can use them with the `az bot create` command.  

```cmd
az bot create --kind webapp --name <bot-resource-name> --location <geographic-location> --version v4 --lang <language> --verbose --resource-group <resource-group-name> --appid "<application-id>" --password "<application-password>" --verbose
```

| Option | Description |
|:---|:---|
| --name | A unique name that is used to deploy the bot in Azure. It could be the same name as your local bot. DO NOT include spaces or underscores in the name. |
| --location | Geographic location used to create the bot service resources. For example, `eastus`, `westus`, `westus2`, and so on. |
| --lang | The language to use to create the bot: `Csharp`, or `Node`; default is `Csharp`. |
| --resource-group | Name of resource group in which to create the bot. You can configure the default group using `az configure --defaults group=<name>`. |
| --appid | The Microsoft account ID (MSA ID) to be used with the bot. |
| --password | The Microsoft account (MSA) password for the bot. |

#### Business or school account

```cmd
az bot create --kind webapp --name <bot-resource-name> --location <geographic-location> --version v4 --lang <language> --verbose --resource-group <resource-group-name>
```

| Option | Description |
|:---|:---|
| --name | A unique name that is used to deploy the bot in Azure. It could be the same name as your local bot. DO NOT include spaces or underscores in the name. |
| --location | Geographic location used to create the bot service resources. For example, `eastus`, `westus`, `westus2`, and so on. |
| --lang | The language to use to create the bot: `Csharp`, or `Node`; default is `Csharp`. |
| --resource-group | Name of resource group in which to create the bot. You can configure the default group using `az configure --defaults group=<name>`. |

### Download the bot from Azure

Next, download the bot you just created. This command will create a subdirectory under the save-path; however, the specified path must already exist.

```cmd
az bot download --name <bot-resource-name> --resource-group <resource-group-name> --save-path "<path>"
```

| Option | Description |
|:---|:---|
| --name | The name of the bot in Azure. |
| --resource-group | Name of resource group the bot is in. |
| --save-path | An existing directory to download bot code to. |

### Decrypt the downloaded .bot file

The sensitive information in the .bot file is encrypted.

Get the encryption key.

1. Log into the [Azure portal](http://portal.azure.com/).
1. Open the Web App Bot resource for your bot.
1. Open the bot's **Application Settings**.
1. In the **Application Settings** window, scroll down to the **Application settings**.
1. Locate the **botFileSecret** and copy its value.

Decrypt the .bot file.

```cmd
msbot secret --bot <name-of-bot-file> --secret "<bot-file-secret>" --clear
```

| Option | Description |
|:---|:---|
| --bot | The relative path to the downloaded .bot file. |
| --secret | The encryption key. |

### Use the downloaded .bot file in your project

Copy the decrypted .bot file to the directory that contains your local bot project.

Update your bot to use this new .bot file.

# [C#](#tab/csharp)

In **appsettings.json**, update the **botFilePath** property to point to the new .bot file.

# [JavaScript](#tab/javascript)

In **.env**, update the **botFilePath** property to point to the new .bot file.

---

### Update the .bot file

If your bot uses LUIS, QnA Maker, or Dispatch services, you will need to add references to them to your .bot file. Otherwise, you can skip this step.

1. Open your bot in the BotFramework Emulator, using the new .bot file. The bot does not need to be running locally.
1. In the **BOT EXPLORER** panel, expand the **SERVICES** section.
1. To add references to LUIS apps, click the plus-sign (+) to the right of **SERVICES**.
   1. Select **Add Language Understanding (LUIS)**.
   1. If it prompts you to log into your Azure account, do so.
   1. It presents a list of LUIS applications you have access to. Select the ones for your bot.
1. To add references to a QnA Maker knowledge base, click the plus-sign (+) to the right of **SERVICES**.
   1. Select **Add QnA Maker**.
   1. If it prompts you to log into your Azure account, do so.
   1. It presents a list of knowledge bases you have access to. Select the ones for your bot.
1. To add references to Dispatch models, click the plus-sign (+) to the right of **SERVICES**.
   1. Select **Add Dispatch**.
   1. If it prompts you to log into your Azure account, do so.
   1. It presents a list of Dispatch models you have access to. Select the ones for your bot.

### Test your bot locally

At this point, your bot should work the same way it did with the old .bot file. Make sure that it works as expected with the new .bot file.

### Publish your bot to Azure

<!-- TODO: re-encrypt your .bot file? -->

Publish your local bot to Azure. This step might take a while.

```cmd
az bot publish --name <bot-resource-name> --proj-name "<project-file-name>" --resource-group <resource-group-name> --code-dir <directory-path> --verbose --version v4
```

| Option | Description |
|:---|:---|
| --name | The resource name of the bot in Azure. |
| --proj-name | For C#, use the startup project file name (without the .csproj) that needs to be published. For example: `EnterpriseBot`. For Node.js, use the main entry point for the bot. For example, `index.js`. |
| --resource-group | Name of resource group. |
| --code-dir | The directory to upload bot code from. |

Once this completes with a "Deployment successful!" message, your bot is deployed in Azure.

<!-- TODO: If we tell them to re-encrypt, this step is not necessary. -->

Clear the encryption key setting.

1. Log into the [Azure portal](http://portal.azure.com/).
1. Open the Web App Bot resource for your bot.
1. Open the bot's **Application Settings**.
1. In the **Application Settings** window, scroll down to the **Application settings**.
1. Locate the **botFileSecret** and delete it.

## Additional resources
