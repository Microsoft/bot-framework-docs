# Bot Framework SDK for .NET samples

::: moniker range="azure-bot-service-3.0"

[!INCLUDE [pre-release-label](../includes/pre-release-label-v3.md)]

These samples demonstrate task-focused bots that show how to take advantage of features in the Bot Framework SDK for .NET. You can use the samples to help you quickly get started with building great bots with rich capabilities.

## Get the samples
To get the samples, clone the [BotBuilder-Samples](https://github.com/Microsoft/BotBuilder-Samples) GitHub repository using Git.
