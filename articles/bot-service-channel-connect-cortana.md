# Connect a bot to Cortana

Cortana is a speech-enabled channel that can send and receive voice messages in addition to textual conversation. A bot intended to connect to Cortana should be designed for speech as well as text. A Cortana *skill* is a bot that can be invoked using a Cortana client. Publishing a bot adds the bot to the list of available skills.

To add the Cortana channel, open the bot in the [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com/), click the **Channels** blade, and then click **Cortana**.

## Configure Cortana

When connecting your bot with the Cortana channel, some basic information about your bot will be pre-filled into the registration form. Review this information carefully. This form consists of the following fields.

| Field | Description |
|------|------|
| **Skill icon** | An icon that is displayed in the Cortana canvas when your skill is invoked. This is also used where skills are discoverable (like the Microsoft store). (32KB max, PNG only).|
| **Display name** | The name of your Cortana skill is displayed to the user at the top of the visual UI. (30 character limit) |
| **Invocation name** | This is the name users say when invoking a skill. It should be no more than three words and easy to pronounce. See the [Invocation Name Guidelines][invocation] for more information on how to choose this name.|
| **Description** | A description of your Cortana skill. This is used where skills are discoverable (like the Microsoft store). |
| **Short description** | A short description of your skill’s functionality, used to describe the skill in Cortana’s notebook. |

## General bot information

Under the **Manage user identity through connected services section** press the option to enable it. Fill in the form.

All fields marked with an asterisk (*) are required. Bots must be published on the Bot Framework before they can be connected to Cortana.

### Sign in at invocation

Select this option if you want Cortana to sign in the user at the time they invoke your skill.

### Sign in when required

Select this option if you use a Bot Framework's SignIn card to sign in the user. Typically, you use this option if you want to sign in the user only if they use a feature that requires authentication. When your skill sends a message that includes the SignIn card as an attachment, Cortana ignores the SignIn card and performs the authorization flow using the Connect Account settings.

### Connected service icon

The icon that you want displayed when the user signs in to your skill.

### Account name

The name of your skill that you want displayed when the user signs in to your skill.

### Client ID for third-party services

Your bot's application ID. You received the ID when you registered your bot.

### Space-separated list of scopes

Specify the scopes that the service requires (see the service's documentation).

### Authorization URL

Set to `https://login.microsoftonline.com/common/oauth2/v2.0/authorize`.

### Grant type

Select Authorization code to use code grant flow. Select Implicit to use implicit flow.

### Token URL

If you select Authorization code, set to `https://login.microsoftonline.com/common/oauth2/v2.0/token`.

### Client secret/password for third party services

The bot's password. You received the password when you registered your bot.

### Client authentication scheme

Select HTTP Basic.

### Token options

Set to POST.

### Request user profile data (optional)

Cortana provides access to several different types of user profile information, that you can use to customize the bot for the user. For example, if a skill has access to the user’s name and location then the skill can have custom response such as “Hello Kamran, I hope you are having a pleasant day in Bellevue, Washington.”

Click the **Add a user profile request** link, then select the user profile information you want from the drop-down list. Add a friendly name to use to access this information from your bot's code.

### Save skill

When you are done filling out the registration form for your Cortana skill, click Save to complete the connection. This brings you back to your bot's Channels blade and you should see that it is now connected to Cortana.

At this point your bot has already been automatically deployed as a Cortana skill to your account.
